### Development TODOs
Integrate Exchange/Autodiscover.
- should export an object for configuration since we can only 2010_SP1 or greater (I think? could be 2013)
- - 2010 should work according to this: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/hh312849(v=exchg.140).aspx
- - but it is not listed as compatible here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn458792(v=exchg.150).aspx
Need to figure out how to authorize the mailer.
